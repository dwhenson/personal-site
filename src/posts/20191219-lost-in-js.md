_EDIT: I wrote this just after I started learning but updated it with new resources and links just before I launched my personal site three years later._

I was stumbling around not really knowing where to start with JavaScript. People say it's an easy language to learn, but for me, as my first introduction to a <em>proper</em> coding language it wasn't. I somehow tripped over the course when an email arrived in my inbox. The email was great - it promised everything I wanted from a course on an language that I was really nervous about starting.

If only as much effort had been put into the course itself I might have got on better. The course left me feeling frustrated, and unsure of how to go forward, and to be honest feeling a totally inadequate. I really plugged away at the course for a while, and maybe it did me more good than I realise, but I'm not sure I really got much benefit.

To be fair, I did get a full refund from the developer as promised, The lesson for me was do your research when it comes to online courses, go in slowly, and check the refund policy!

On the other hand [watch and code](https://watchandcode.com). Is a great example of what you can learn for free. Gordon has put together about 28 hours of free content that provides a unique intro to plain vanilla JS. It's a serious course and even though I've <em>completed</em> it I don't think I've internalised the concepts.

I followed up the course by paying for the advanced course for one month. This was interesting but be ready for a very serious learning environment, which to be honest was pretty intimidating for a beginner like me. Gordon provides a space between for serious learners together and support be each other, but it's not for everyone. And to be honest, at this early stage it wasn't for me.

If I had more time to dedicate to learning JS and a reasonable knowledge of basic programming concepts such as standard methods, and perhaps jQuery, this is the course I would follow, and is one I hope to perhaps return to. But it was just too much, too soon for me at this stage. That said I've no regrets at all about paying for one month as the free lessons were worth it.

It was as I was recovering from my WatchandCode experience [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) released his [Beginner JavaScript Course](https://beginnerjavascript.com). The timing was great for me and having scored a sporty deal on Black Friday, I didn't have to spend too much to try it out. I love this course. Wes's enthusiasm just oozes through each video, which is great. But unfortunately, I don't think I actually learn that well from watching videos, even when I code along.

I've no complaints about the course and it's a great reference that I go back to, I just didn't internalise much as I did it. _[EDIT: I have since referred back to lessons in this course many times. I think it's a great introduction to JS. To really learn the basics of JS I found [Chris Ferdinandi's JavaScript Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) <em>the</em> course that got me conformable with the basics - I discuss this more in the next post.]_
