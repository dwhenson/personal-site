I really like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Itâ€™s fast, functional and looks pretty good straight out of the box. [Other people like it](https://tonsky.me/blog/sublime/) for different reasons. To start with though it can be a bit tricky to get used to adjusting settings and getting comfortable with how to adjust things.

Honestly, if you just want to get up and running and do what most people do, then just use VS Code, it's free, people really like it, and, unless you are on a super-slow computer, it will just work and do more than you ever need. I've done a fair bit of coding using VS Code, and it is easier to customise than Sublime, and more beginner friendly.

I recently upgraded from an old MacBook Air, which was just too slow to run VS Code. So I gave it another try, and I just don't like it. I am doing simple work most of the time with HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and not a lot more. I love that Sublime starts off with the absolute minimum of things, and then I get to choose what to add as I encounter the need.

I hope that if you are keen to try Sublime, and are perhaps a bit intimidated by a JSON file of settings, installing packages, and playing around things, that this series of posts might make things easier for you. I have only scratched the surface of Sublime Text, so please do let me know if you see any errors or other ways that I can do things better.
