There’s some excellent free or cheap resources out there to help you get started coding without much cost.

Being comfortable while working really matters to me. Aside, from a nice fast, resistance-free computer, which I can’t really help you with (and I am still waiting for...), when I work I want to be looking at something beautiful and working with an intuitive programme on a screen that doesn’t make my eyes hurt.

As soon as I started learning HTML it quickly became clear that a lot of my time was going to be spent in a text or code editor, and finding the right one for me would be worth spending a bit of time on. Although text a regular text editor could work, code editors offer many advantages that make coding much easier - at least to start with.

Finding a cracking code editor

I focused on finding an editor with the features I wanted rather than on appearances. All the code editors I tried appeared pretty much the same on a screen, and most of them have themes that you can add to make them look any way you like.

The main Features I was looking for in a code editor were:

- Auto-completion - I want the editor to automatically close the tags for me, and add closing brackets where necessary;
- Indenting automatically - I want to be able to sort out all the white space and layout my page with one-click;
- Error checking - I want an indication when I haven't done something I should have (like close a tag or a bracket);
- Spell checker - I need the programme to check my spellings. Ideally the checker will ignore code text and focus on words;
- Wrapping text - I want to be able to paste in a load of text, select it all and add the opening and closing tags in one go;
- Auto refresh - I want to see a live preview (ideally more than one browser) without having to save and refresh the whole time.

When you are just getting going on think this is the perfect editor to start with. Zero set up, and white you can easily add extensions of you like, it just works straight out of the box. (Once you've got up and running, after trying out Sublime Text for a couple of months, I'd recommend using VS Code, and I would highly recommend shifting to that eventually — but to start with, and maybe for even longer, Brackets is just fine).

Doubling with Duet - Hang on I think you can do this for free now!

The other app that has helped me get comfortable coding is Duet. This is a really handy app that can turn an iPad into a second screen for your Mac. I'm not at the stage right now where I have the space or the need to splash out on a big screen. But with Brackets and Chrome open on my 13' laptop there's not much space for watching tutorial videos.

With Duet I've been able to have the videos playing on my iPad screen while coding and keeping an eye out the rendering in a browser on my laptop screen. And I'm no longer hitting C-TAB the whole time to move through the three windows. Duet was a cinch to set up, and once I realised that I had my iPad on the opposite side to where my computer thought it was, I've had zero issues and it's been a pleasure to use.
