_EDIT: I wrote this just after I started learning but updated it with new resources and links just before I launched my personal site three years later._

I was really afraid to start building something for some reason. I guess it was because I had spent so much time learning, and I was afraid that when it came to it I would still be totally rubbish? And guess what, when it came down to it I totally sucked at building an actual webpage. **But!** I learnt a lot and it really helped me identify where I needed to focus my work on in the future.

To create my master piece, I basically got a nice picture on unsplash, found icons that would kind of go with the picture (well they both had bits of yellow on them) and went for it. I <q>designed</q> straight into the browser, with no preconceived idea of what the final page or site would look like. It looked terrible. Simple things that I <q>knew</q> how to do following my hours of tutorials didn't work, the design was terrible. I was a failure.

I'm laughing now, but I actually pretty quite down about the whole thing at the time. But, I learned that

0. I need to learn about design
1. I need a lot more practice building actual things (and ideally getting feedback on them); and
2. I'd a little ways to go before anyone might actually pay me to do this kind of work.

Fortunately, there's some great resources out there to help for free. Here's two of my favourites:

0. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) - This provides a nicely laid out pathway with links to free resources that will give you the knowledge to have a go at the challenges. I've only done the assignments in the HTML and CSS sections, but I found them very helpful.
1. [Frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - This is the best resource I found for HTML and CSS challenges and getting feedback. There's no pathway as such but a good number of challenges, with all the assets you need included, that you can have a go at building using any approach you like.

Using these resources quickly exposed me to a whole new set of areas where I didn't realise I needed to up my game in particular version control (i.e. git and GitHub) to enable me to submit solutions on both the Odin Project and Frontendmentor. It seems to me that git is both a wonderful blessing and an absolute curse - I've got in some right messes with it already, and I've not even collaborated on a repo yet!
