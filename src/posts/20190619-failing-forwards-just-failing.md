title: Failing Forwards, or Just Failing?

lead: It's easy to avoid it, but sooner or later you're going to have to build something; make it sooner.

_EDIT: I wrote this just after I started learning but updated it with new resources and links just before I launched my personal site three years later._

I was really afraid to start building something for some reason. I guess it was because I had spent so much time learning, and I was scared that when it came to it I would still be totally rubbish? And guess what, when it came down to it I totally sucked at building an actual webpage. **But!** I learnt a lot and it really helped me identify where I needed to focus my work on in the future.

## My Delusions Vanish

To create my master piece, I basically got a nice picture on unsplash, found some icons that would kind of go with the picture (well they both had bits of yellow on them) and went for it. I <q>designed</q> straight into the browser, with no preconceived idea of what the final page or site would look like. It looked terrible. Simple things that I <q>knew</q> how to do following my hours of tutorials didn't work.

**I was a failure.**

I'm laughing now, but I actually pretty quite down about the whole thing at the time. But, I learned that

1. I need to learn about design, and design is not easy
1. I need a lot more practice building actual things; and
1. I'd have a long way to go before anyone might actually pay me to do this

## Getting Back on Track

Fortunately, there's some great resources out there to help you get started with building things for free. Here's two of my favourites:

1. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) - This provides a nicely laid out pathway with links to free resources that will give you the knowledge to have a go at the challenges. I've only done the assignments in the HTML and CSS sections, but I found them very helpful.
1. [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - This is the best resource I found for HTML and CSS challenges and getting feedback. There's no pathway abut a lot of challenges at different levels, with all the assets you need included, that you can have a go at building using any approach you like.

Using these resources as a basis for practising building things quickly exposed me to a whole new set of areas where I didn't realise I needed to up my game. E.g. version control (i.e. git and GitHub) to enable me to submit solutions on both the Odin Project and Frontendmentor, and pretty much everything else I had previously <q>learnt</q> coding along in tutorial land!
