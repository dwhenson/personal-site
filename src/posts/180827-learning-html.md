With access to on-line tutorials and a couple books you can totally crack HTML.

I was a little intimidated at first, but, you know what, it wasn't actually that bad. Pretty manageable in fact. Even for someone like me who had never written a line of code before starting out (I only found out later that apparently HMTL isn't code). [Link?]. I had last had anything to do with the backend of a website in 1997 - using Macromedia Dreamweaver (thanks wayback machine check out that table layout!).

No, learning HTML was in fact pretty straight forward. And, actually, as it seems that HTML5 is now pretty standard and widely supported, around about now seems like a great time to be learning the language.

HTML5 just seems to make sense. In fact, I kind of wonder why it took so long to strip all formatting out of HTML, and add standardised tags that actually mean something. I love the focus on pure structure and 'semantics' (using tags that add meaning to a document layout), while keeping all formatting and styling totally separate.

If you've ever added formatting to a document using the numbered headings or other functions in Word, HTML will quickly make sense. Of course, there are a fair few HTML tags to get your head around (in fact as you dive deeper there seems to be an almost never ending list), but it really is manageable to get your head around the small number of most useful tags pretty quickly.

I mainly learnt HTML through courses on Lynda.com. I really, really liked the courses by James Williamson. I found 'HTML Essential Training' and 'HTML5: Structure, Syntax and Semantics' particularly useful. I also followed courses on tables (oh, how that has changed since 1997!), audio and video, and web forms. I really wanted to get a good understanding of HTML and feel comfortable with it before moving on to CSS.

I also found the 'HTML and CSS' book by Jon Ducket a very useful reference. It's a little dated now with regard some aspects of HTML5, but it's beautiful to look at and a joy to read. I continually referred back to this book as different aspects of HTML were covered in the Lynda courses I was following. I'm currently in the middle of a couple of courses on images and I am still referring back to this book.

Later on, I also found 'Learning Web Design' by Jennifer Robbins (the 5th edition only came out last year and so it is quite up-to-date). I really, really like this book. In fact, if I were to recommend one book that I've come across for learning web design it would be this one. OK, it may look a little more textbook than the Duckett book, but its very readable, really comprehensive, up-to-date (at the time of writing this), and is still pretty nice to look at.

With some dedication, patience, and access to online tutorials and a couple of good reference books, managing, if not mastering, HTML is totally doable.
