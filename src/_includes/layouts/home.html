    <h2 class="h1">About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a self-taught developer happiest working at the front of the frontend.  For the moment, I'm focused on building my skills writing accessible HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript, and getting to grips with Static Site Generators. I am also studying website performance and dipping my toes into UX and UI design</p>

     <p> I’m based in Nairobi, Kenya, but I have plenty of experience working with remote teams. I'm looking to transition from my current career into a part-time developer role. I'd love to find a position where I can keep learning and start to apply my skills in a professional setting.
