    <p>I’m a self-taught developer happiest working at the front of the frontend.  For the moment, I'm focused on building my skills writing accessible HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript, and getting to grips with static site generators (this site is built using Eleventy). I am also learning about website performance and dipping my toes into UX and UI design.</p>

     <p>I’m based in Nairobi, Kenya. I have plenty of experience working with remote teams from my current career. I aim to transition into a frontend developer role over the next year or so. I'd love to find a position where I grow and learn how to apply my skills in a professional setting. Please do <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>; I'd love to hear about what you are working on and if I could help.
