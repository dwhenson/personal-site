title: "Manage"
summary: "This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the designs provided. From the design specs it seemed the carousel was only needed on small screens. I made this happen, but only on page load. As a result, the page responds fine moving from large to small screens, as the content is visible, but not the other way around. I didn't enjoy coding this aspect of the challenge."

background: "This project was a challenge from <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io'>Frontend Mentor</a>. The carousel is problematic. It's not accessible, and the buttons for changing the image shown are too small. This is in line with the design. I used <a href='https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema'>Siema</a> for the carousel. But even the creator notes 'I consider carousels as an anti-pattern and I would suggest you to find a better UI pattern than carousel for your current project.' I would agree. "
