title: "Bookmark"
summary: "This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the designs provided. The page is created so that everything is progressively enhanced in case CSS or JavaScript fail. The burger-menu will not kick in and all navigation items remain visible, the tabbed interface will not hide any content, and the `details-summary` FAQ section will work, but not animate on open. It won't look great, but everything should still be visible and work."

background: "This project was a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I used Heydon Pickering's [in-depth write up on tabbed interfaces](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/) as a basis for the tabbed component, which was especially useful for dealing with the tab order. The burger-menu is based on Andy Bell's totally full on [fully responsive progressively enhanced burger menu ](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/) which is excellent and very robust."
