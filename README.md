# Personal Site

The code for [my personal site](https://www.dwhenson.com/) built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), the CSS structure follows largely follows [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/). I also use Andy Bell's [fully responsive progressively enhanced burger menu ](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/) and Chris Ferdinandi's [bouncer](https://github.com/cferdinandi/bouncer) for form validation.

Any comments or suggestions for improvements are most welcome. My site's [contact page](https://dwhenson.com/contact/) is the best way to do this.
